# Python-for-Finance
This is the Python for finance according to the tutorial series on python programming.net. I modified it for python 2.7. 
Currently, it includes half of the series excluding the quantopian part.
At the end of the tutorial (T12.py) includes a machine learning algorithm with support vector machine and random forest classifier to predict the stock price.
